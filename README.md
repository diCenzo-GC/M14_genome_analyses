diCenzo GC, Debiec K, Krzysztoforski J, Uhrynowski W, Mengoni A, Fagorzi C, Gorecki A, Dziewit L, Bajda T, Rzepa G, Drewniak L. (2018) Genomic and biotechnological characterization of the heavy-metal resistant, arsenic-oxidizing bacterium Ensifer sp. M14. Genes. 9(8): 379. 

A set of scripts used to perform the analyses reported in the above paper. If you use adaptations of any of these scripts or pipelines as part of your work, please cite our article.

In some cases, manual steps may have been performed as part of the overall pipeline of the different analyses. Additionally, the scripts contain references to directories found on our machine. As such, it is expected that attempting to simply run these scripts without adaptation will fail to replicate our results.
